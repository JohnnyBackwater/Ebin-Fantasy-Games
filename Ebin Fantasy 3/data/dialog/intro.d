/These are comments
Time has changed it's form.
Tons of jugs have disappeared from our local shop.
They where mostly empty, however, this only can mean one thing.
Gods have awaken!
We fear that Jugs, the god of chaos has taken actions in our mortal world
It is uncertain what is still going on but one thing is certain...
Orges are on the move. We must preapare for war. They are attacking our town
Get out to the field and push them back!
