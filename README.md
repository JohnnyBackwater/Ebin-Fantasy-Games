# Ebin-Fantasy-Games
My first coding projects outside of studies. Started right with the level of "programming 101" course and looks like it. They are text based RPG adventures

Ebin Fantasy I is like parody game to Final Fantasy series and fantasy and RPG genre in general. Also it includes some inside jokes of my friend circes and memes from internet.

Ebin Fantasy sersies consists of 3 titles and each title are started from scratch, hence text based command prompt games are somewhat easy  to make.
